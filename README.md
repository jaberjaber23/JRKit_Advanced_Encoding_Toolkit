Encoding Methods
Leave-One-Out Encoder: This encoder leverages the "leave-one-out" strategy to encode categorical variables, minimizing data leakage and providing reliable representations.

EMWEncoder (Exponential Moving Window Encoder): EMWEncoder uses an exponential moving window to encode sequential data, capturing temporal dynamics for efficient feature extraction.

RBFEncoder (Radial Basis Function Encoder): RBFEncoder converts categorical variables into continuous representations using radial basis functions, preserving relationships and enabling smooth transitions.

Regularized Linear Regression Encoder: This encoder combines linear regression and regularization techniques to encode categorical features, learning optimal coefficients while controlling model complexity.
